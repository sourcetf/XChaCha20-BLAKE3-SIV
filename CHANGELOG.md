# Changelog

Short, and deliberately about **the wire format** first: this construction is not a
standard, so a consumer needs to know when the bytes move. Versions below refer to
construction revisions; the crate version in `Cargo.toml` is `0.1.0` and no release
tags have been cut yet.

## Unreleased

- **Fixed: ctgrind's suppression covered whole entry points, not the decision.**
  `tests/ctgrind.supp` named `decrypt` and `decrypt_in_place_detached`, and a
  valgrind entry permits *every* conditional jump in the function it names — so a
  secret-dependent branch added inside `decrypt` passed the check (measured on a
  copy: 6 reports with no suppression file, 0 with it). The decision now lives in
  `accept_or_reject`, a function of its own that both entry points call and that
  returns a `Result` so no caller branches on it a second time; the suppression
  names that function and nothing else. **No wire-format change**, and the decision
  itself is unchanged in structure (including the `hardened` gates, whose
  instruction-level fault scan was re-run: 3081 bytes in the default build and 3987
  in the hardened one, none accepting).
- `tools/ctgrind.sh` now refuses to run unless every suppression entry names
  `accept_or_reject`, and plants a secret-dependent branch inside `decrypt` and
  inside `decrypt_in_place_detached` in a throwaway copy and requires its own check
  to *fail* — the control for the scope of the suppression. It also no longer dies
  silently when it cannot find its test binary (a failed `grep` under
  `set -o pipefail` killed the script before the diagnostic could print).
- `tools/fi_check.sh` and `tools/fi_instruction.sh` follow the decision into its
  own symbol, so both still target it; `tools/mutation_check.sh`'s `ct_eq` → `==`
  mutation is still caught.
- New tests: `tests/decision_scope.rs` (the suppression file may name only the
  decision; the suppressed function's body holds only the decision's branches) and
  a control-flow inventory in `tests/variable_latency.rs` that fails when the crate's
  branch counts change, so the numbers in `README.md` and `SECURITY.md` cannot go
  stale unnoticed — which is how the previous count was found to be stale.
- **Fault-injection hardening, opt-in** (`hardened` feature): the accept/reject
  decision becomes two independently recomputed checks with separate branches.
  **No wire-format change**; the KATs and both differential fixtures replay
  unchanged. Measured cost +10.8% at 64 bytes, below +4.5% from 1 KiB up.
- **Fault-injection check** (`tools/fi_check.sh`) plus its detector
  (`tests/decision.rs`), and a CI step for both.
- **Large-message reference vectors** (`tests/vectors_differential_large.txt`):
  six sizes from 2 KiB to 1 MiB as digests, so the sizes above the tag's
  contiguous-buffer threshold are witnessed against the reference implementation
  rather than only against this crate's own two call shapes.
- Lint gates: `clippy::undocumented_unsafe_blocks`, and `missing_docs` for the
  library. `unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn` is recorded in `Cargo.toml` as deliberately
  pending.
- `SECURITY.md`, and a scheduled "wide audit" job for the checks that are too slow
  or too noisy to gate every push.

## v0.2

- Replaced the v0.1 Poly1305/CTX-tag construction with keyed BLAKE3 and a 65-byte
  tag, and added the contiguous-buffer fast path for mid-sized messages.
  **Wire format changed**: v0.1 ciphertexts and tags do not decrypt.

## v0.1

- Initial construction: XChaCha20 nonce extension (HChaCha20 subkey), Poly1305 with
  a CTX-transformed 32-byte tag.
